## I realize the transformative potential of Virtual and Augmented Reality through user experience.

AR/VR has enormous impact potential, due to itâ€™s ability to transform mundane tasks into immersive and productive experiences. However, for AR/VR to succeed, we must improve the base user experience, so that everyone wants to use it.

I bring the User Experience skills, passion, and drive needed to bring VR/AR to the next level of adoption.

## Professional Philosophy

### Be A Barrier Breaker

I thrive when I'm helping others to be their best. Whether its providing business communication, acting as a sounding board for brainstorming, or even knowing when to stay out of the way, I take pleasure in breaking down the barriers that impede innovation.

### Embrace Ambiguity
Life's unclear, and the fast-paced industry experience is often even more so. I've embraced this aspect of my professional life, and look forward to making my mark in unclear situations others would avoid.

### Keep Growing
I'm always looking for new ways to expand my capabilities. I regularly review both industry and academic research to advance my UX knowledge. I constantly explore new UX techniques and VR/AR technology platforms.

## I'm a pretty fun guy outside of work, too.

### Bring on the Food
I'm a major foodie, and I'm up for whatever's good. Great Asian and old-fashioned diners are particularly my jam.

### Let's Go for a Ride
I bike regularly, using it as a way to get space to review my day. I have a distinct preference for scenic forest trails and waterways.

### Up For Gaming
If you have a company board game night or video game tournament, I'm there! I'm constantly introducing new people to my favorite hobby.
